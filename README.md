# Throughput Metrics

This repository is intended to manage metrics for the Throughput Project.  Metrics of success for this project were defined in the project proposal and are detailled here.  The intention is to clearly link project metrics to outcomes of each individual repository within this organization to provide a single source and document to compile progress and success of the Throughput Project.

## Contributors

This project is an open project, and contributiosn are welcome from anyone.  All contributors to this project are bound by a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Please review and follow this code of conduct as part of your contribution.

## How to use this repository

This project is organized as a document of record using this README file.  It is also structured as a standalone Single Page Application (SPA) using `vue.js`.

### System Requirements

This project is developed using `vue.js`.  It should provide cross-platform support for linux and windows based systems.

### Data Requirements

The project pulls data from the Throughput API and from other repositories within this project.

### Key Outputs

This project generates a single page application that monitors individual project metrics within the Throughput project.

## Metrics

This project is to be evaluated using Project Metrics defined in the Throughput project proposal.

### Annotation infrastructure

**GOAL** Improving the cyberinfrastructure required to maintain and serve an Annotation database for the Earth Sciences.

**METRICS**

   * Development of a testing suite for the database and fully integrated development/production system.
   * Clear documentation for online collaboration and protocols for bug reporting.
   * Adoption and management of a Project Board system.
   * Public database landing page with key reporting metrics (data volume, query speeds, etc.)

**GOAL** Building user interfaces to support user groups within the earth sciences including:
   * Direct annotation
   * The Earth Science Cookbook.

**METRICS**

   * Direct annotation landing page built and tagged in a version control system (GitHub), with Usability report from the UMN Usability Lab.
   * Documentation surrounding the usability report.
   * Earth Science Cookbook UI built and tagged in version control system.
   * Usability report from the Usability Lab.

### Workflow Discovery

**GOAL** Establishing a platform to support the addition of workflow elements to the TAE and to link primary data resources in the geosciences through publicly available code.

**METRICS**
   * Number of scripts recovered by programmatic workflows
   * Number of user-submitted scripts
   * Number of data resources connected through scripts
   * Number of users accessing scripts through the system
   * Number of workshops (and number of participants) that use annotation as an element in instruction.

### Cross-Disciplinary Access

**GOAL** To improve cross-disciplinary research outcomes by linking data across repositories using a range of tools, and vocabularies.

**METRICS**
   * Clear documentation of workflows for GeoDeepDive-based annotation
   * Number of annotations generated by cross-disciplinary linking activity
   * Number of end user workshops held and number of participants
   * Number of data repositories linked through cross-disciplinary annotations.
